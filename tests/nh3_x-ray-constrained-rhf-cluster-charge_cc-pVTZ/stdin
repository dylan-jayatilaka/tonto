         thermal_smearing_model= tanaka

         ! This option describes how thermal smearing should be
         ! applied to basis functions which are *not* on the same
         ! atom. (ADP's specified later with each atom).  The
         ! "tanaka" scheme is based on gaussian basis functions; 
         ! a weighted average of the ADP's on each atom is used, the
         ! weight of the ADP !  on one atom being proportional to the
         ! relative distance of the centre of the product-pair
         ! gaussian to the other atom. You should use Hirshfeld from
         ! now on, unless you know what you are doing.

         partition_model= gaussian

         ! This tells how the molecular fragment in the crystal is to
         ! be partitioned into atoms, in order to correctly calculate
         ! the structure factors. It only has an effect if the
         ! molecular fragment is *not* an even multiple of the 
         ! asymmetric unit under the symmetry operations of the
         ! spacegroup. You can choose "gaussian" or "mulliken".

         ! Explanation: when the atoms in the molecular fragment are
         ! mapped into themselves by the crystal symmetry operations
         ! more than one time---this is called the repetition
         ! factor---the density for this atom must be multiplied by
         ! the *inverse* of the repetition factor, otherwise the Fourier
         ! transform will be too large by that factor. If all the
         ! atoms are mapped into themselves by the *same* repetition
         ! factor, there is no problem: we need only scale the 
         ! density by the inverse of this common repetiton factor to
         ! calculate the correct structure factor. However, if some
         ! atoms have different repetition factors, we must apply
         ! these different repetition factors to the atomic densities.
         ! Unfortunately, in quantum mechanics the  density cannot be
         ! easily decomposed into atomic contributions. Since we are
         ! using products of pairs of basis functions centered on
         ! atoms, it is natural to use basis functions to define these
         ! atomic densities. This option tells how we apportion the
         ! density to one atom or the other from a pair of basis
         ! functions centered on two different atoms.  This is very
         ! similar to the problem of partitioning the ADP's on two
         ! atoms, in order to calculate the thermally smeared
         ! structure factors.  There are two schemes which can be
         ! applied: "gaussian" and "mulliken".  The "gaussian" scheme 
         ! is analogous to the "tanaka" scheme for ADP partitioning. The
         ! "mulliken" scheme is simply an assignment of half the
         ! density of the basis function pair to each atom, and is in
         ! some ways similar to the "stewart" or "coppens" models used
         ! for thermal smearing.

         ! NOTE: when using the Hirshfeld thermal smearing model there
         ! are no overlap (two-center) density contributions so this
         ! option has *no effect*

         ! Using a desired sub-portion of the wavefunction: It is
         ! possible to manually override the repetition factors which
         ! are calculated automatically by the program. This is useful
         ! if you want to calculate the structure factors for, and
         ! hence constrain the wavefunction to, a desired sub-portion
         ! of a molecular fragment. For example, one might wish to
         ! calculate the structure factors from only the central
         ! molecule in a cluster of molecules---and not perform any
         ! wavefunction constraints on the molecules which are not in
         ! the centre of the cluster: these molecules would be there
         ! only to provide a kind of "crystal field" to the central
         ! molecule. In this case one must set the
         ! "repetition_factors" for the non-central cluster atoms to be
         ! zero. Use the "repetition_factors=" command.


         optimise_extinction= true

         !  This is set to be true if a Larsen-like extinction
         ! correction is to be applied and optimised in the model. A
         ! scale factor is automatically refined simultaneously.

   !  Begin atom information ...

   ! The selection of the atoms to be used in the constrained

   ! with more than one type of molecule (Z'>1). You can use the Crystal
   ! Explorer graphical user interface to choose an appropriate
   ! molecular fragment which is a good starting approximation to the
   ! crystal. Crystal Explorer will generate the atomic
   ! positions in cartesian coordiantes, and also the associated
   ! ADP's. These positions and ADP's can then be entered in an
   ! atoms= data block, as above, but without the "{ axis_system=
   ! crystal }" embedded command (since it specifies that the crystal 
   ! axis system is to be used).
