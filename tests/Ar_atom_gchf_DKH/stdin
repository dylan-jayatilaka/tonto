     use_so_fdff= FALSE ! DEFAULT = FALSE (works for the DKH Hamiltonin and the PCE correction)
                        ! it activates additional terms from spin orbit part which contribute also
                        ! to the scalar part (These terms are neglected in the papers of Hess et al)

                        ! In the case of the 2-component DKH2 caluclation in the Dirac08 package these terms
                        ! are accounted

!   use_ppzpp= FALSE ! the DEFAULT is not to use ppzpp intgrals in DKH3 and DKH2_PCE calculations
 
! PCE correction 

     use_pce_corr= TRUE ! if electron density gonna be ploted it corrects for the PCE via introducing
                        ! the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation (DK0), recommended in the case of DKH Hamiltonian

     use_DK1_pce= TRUE  ! it is even better to include also the first order correction to the ploted density

     use_DK2_pce= TRUE  ! the the second order correction of PCE
