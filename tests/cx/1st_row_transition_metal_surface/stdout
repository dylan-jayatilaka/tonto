==============
Plot grid data
==============

. Usually, the plot center, plot widths, and plot axes are specified.
  Unless specified otherwise the z-axis width is assumed to be zero
  i.e. it is assumed we are constructing a 2D plot grid.

. The origin is calculated as the front-left-bottom point.

. An atom or atoms may be used to specify the plot center.

. Atoms may also be used to specify the x and y axes; and the y and z
  axes are orthogonalized to the x and y axes, respectively.

. Alternatively, a a bonding box around the molecule may be used.
  The axes diagonalised the moment of inertia tensor using unit
  weight atoms, so-called shape axes.

. For crystals, the unit cell axes may be chosen to be the plot axes.
  In most cases the midpoint of the unit cell is the plot center.
  For CRYSTAL23, the origin is chosen as the plot center

. Normally only the no. of points on the x axis is specified, the no.
  of points on the other axes is adjusted to have the same linear
  point density, roughly.

. Alternatively, a desired point separation is specified. Then the
  no. of points on each axis is calculated to just exceed it.

. All coordinates are in au.
