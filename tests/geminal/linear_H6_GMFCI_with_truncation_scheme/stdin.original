! Next keywords to perform several successive Geminal Mean Field
! Configuration Interaction (GMFCI) steps.
! In general an scf calculation must be performed before to create
! molecular orbitals. 
! Implemented for molecule with even number of electrons, for odd
! number one should add an electron at infinite before making the 
! <ij|kl> archive file.
! Assume a singlet ground state, if not the case results may be
! strange.
