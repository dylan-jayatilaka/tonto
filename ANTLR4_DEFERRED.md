# ANTLR4 translator — deferred minor issues

Tracked for later attention once the full debug build compiles. None of these
block compilation; they are correctness-of-match or robustness refinements.

## Call resolution
- **`MODULE.SUBMOD:proc(...)` selfless assumption.** These calls usually target
  selfless procedures (they can't be called any other way). We currently detect
  selfless targets via a global scan of `::: selfless` headers
  (`buildSelflessMethods`). A proc that is selfless *by being inside an interface
  block* (foo.pl: routines nested >2 scopes are selfless) is NOT caught yet.
  Conversely, any genuine non-selfless `MODULE.SUBMOD:proc` exception should be
  rewritten in the `.foo` with different syntax. (User-flagged.)

## .int generation (deviations vs release/, non-blocking)
- **Uncalled single-member alias interfaces** (e.g. `diagonal_plus_`) are now
  emitted (needed for the *called* ones like `uncompress_from_pyramid_`); release
  omits the uncalled ones. Could be pruned by call-usage analysis.
- **Elemental scalar specific export.** foo.pl omits `public <name>` for elemental
  procs (only the generic `name_`); we emit both. A blanket exclusion regressed
  overloaded elementals, so it needs the overloaded `_i` case spared.
- **Private + uncalled interfaces.** foo.pl (release config) keeps them; a
  `-usd`-style "omit if never called within the module" pass would drop them.
- **Possible release staleness**, e.g. `quote_position_`: source is `private` and
  the proc is only used within STR, so our `private` is arguably more correct than
  release's `public`.

## Cosmetic
- Operator spacing in re-parsed template bodies is canonicalised (`a==b`), which
  matches release's convention but differs from the pre-substitution spacing in a
  few `EQ=>==` template cases (e.g. test_parallel).

## Program / module-variable handling
- **stdin/stdout/stderr as known module variables.** The archaic form
  `TEXTFILE:destroy(stdout)` now works. The modern `stdout.destroy` form needs
  stdin/stdout/stderr recognised as global module variables (foo.pl keeps such a
  table) so the receiver type resolves; verify buildGlobalTable captures them.

## In progress: explicit `self :: INOUT` for non-selfless subroutines (cosmetic tidy)

**Goal (user):** for every non-selfless *subroutine* whose body does not explicitly
declare `self`, emit `self :: INOUT` (i.e. `type(X_TYPE), INOUT :: self`). Does NOT
apply to `functional`/`routinal` procs. This intentionally breaks the regression
vs `release/`; the new translator output is to become the canonical reference.

**One-line change** (reverted for now to keep the tree compiling): in `renderBody`,
the implicit self-decl branch — emit `, INOUT :: self` for a subroutine
(`pd.procHeader().procResult()==null`), plain `:: self` for a function.

**Blocker found — a blanket rule does not compile.** Some non-selfless subroutines
are *read-only* in `self` (they read the object, e.g. a solver). Example:
`MAT{REAL}` `solve_linear_equation` is called `solve_linear_equation_(self(list,list),…)`
where `self(list,list)` is a **vector-subscripted section** — illegal as an
`INOUT`/`OUT` actual argument, so gfortran reports "no specific subroutine for the
generic". With no intent it compiled.

**Options to decide (tomorrow):**
1. Apply the INOUT rule, then declare `self :: IN` explicitly in the *source* for
   the read-only subroutines (find them by iterating compile errors). Matches the
   "where self is not explicitly declared" wording — exceptions declare it.
2. Only mark `self` INOUT when the body actually assigns to self / a component
   (translator-side analysis); read-only subroutines get IN.
3. Decide the function case too: currently functions keep no-intent; for full
   consistency they could be `self :: IN` (but IN risks breaking any function that
   writes self, so validate by rebuild).

Whichever is chosen, re-verify the DEBUG build still compiles+links before
committing, since the output is now the canonical reference.
