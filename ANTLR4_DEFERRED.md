# ANTLR4 translator — deferred minor issues

Tracked for later attention once the full debug build compiles. None of these
block compilation; they are correctness-of-match or robustness refinements.

## Call resolution
- **`MODULE.SUBMOD:proc(...)` selfless assumption.** These calls usually target
  selfless procedures (they can't be called any other way). We currently detect
  selfless targets via a global scan of `::: selfless` headers
  (`buildSelflessMethods`). A proc that is selfless *by being inside an interface
  block* (foo.pl: routines nested >2 scopes are selfless) is NOT caught yet.
  Conversely, any genuine non-selfless `MODULE.SUBMOD:proc` exception should be
  rewritten in the `.foo` with different syntax. (User-flagged.)

## .int generation (deviations vs release/, non-blocking)
- **Uncalled single-member alias interfaces** (e.g. `diagonal_plus_`) are now
  emitted (needed for the *called* ones like `uncompress_from_pyramid_`); release
  omits the uncalled ones. Could be pruned by call-usage analysis.
- **Elemental scalar specific export.** foo.pl omits `public <name>` for elemental
  procs (only the generic `name_`); we emit both. A blanket exclusion regressed
  overloaded elementals, so it needs the overloaded `_i` case spared.
- **Private + uncalled interfaces.** foo.pl (release config) keeps them; a
  `-usd`-style "omit if never called within the module" pass would drop them.
- **Possible release staleness**, e.g. `quote_position_`: source is `private` and
  the proc is only used within STR, so our `private` is arguably more correct than
  release's `public`.

## Cosmetic
- Operator spacing in re-parsed template bodies is canonicalised (`a==b`), which
  matches release's convention but differs from the pre-substitution spacing in a
  few `EQ=>==` template cases (e.g. test_parallel).
