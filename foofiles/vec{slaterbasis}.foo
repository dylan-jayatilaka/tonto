   ! Shrink allocatable "self" to dimension "dim" from the end.

   ! are retained.

   expand(dim,grow_start) ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky, PURE
   ! Expand allocatable "self" to dimension "dim" adding to the end.

!  =======================
!  List-based I/O Routines
!  =======================

   read_list_keywords ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), recursive, leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Read in and process list-based keywords from "stdin". List-based keywords
   ! are those that are intended to apply to each individual element of the list
   ! through a list of "keys" stored in the associated list-element type module.
   ! NOTE: this routine will create the list, if required.
   end

   process_list_keyword(keyword) ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Process a list-type "keyword", common to all list-type objects.
   end

   read_data ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Repeatedly process the "keys" to read in the data list. 
   ! Opening and closing braces are needed.
   end

   read_data_sans_braces ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Repeatedly process the "keys" to read in the data list. 
   ! Opening and closing braces are not needed.
   end

   read_data_BL_terminated ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Repeatedly process the "keys" to read in the data list. Opening
   ! braces are not needed, but a blank line (BL) is used as an
   ! end-of-list terminator.
   end

   data_length_BL_terminated result (length) ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT})
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Read ahead in stdin to get the "length" of the data list. The
   ! data list begins with the first data item, *not* a "{" symbol.
   ! The data list must be terminated by a blank line (BL).
   end

   data_length result (length) ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT})
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Read ahead in stdin to get the "length" of the data list, i.e. the number
   ! of data items in the list. The data must begin with the first data item,
   ! *not* a "{" symbol.  The order of data items comprising the list is given
   ! by keys defined in the associated list-element type module. The data list
   ! must be terminated by a "}" symbol.
   end

   read_altered_data ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Read in a sublist of the complete list, and alter the data for that
   ! sublist.  The order of the data items in the sublist is given by the "keys"
   ! defined in the associated list-element type module.
   end

   read_append_data ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Read in a set of data to append to an existing set.
   end

   process_keys ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Process the "keys" on each element of the list.
   end

   process_keys_once ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT})
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Process the "keys" just once on an anonymous object. This is useful if the
   ! "keys" set global variables in the list module (e.g. the default order of
   ! lists *within* the list data) as opposed to being keys pertaining to each
   ! element of the list.
   end

   keys_created result (res) ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT})
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Return TRUE if the list-element keys are created.
   end

   set_keys(the_keys) ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT})
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! This is for setting the "keys" externally.
   end

   clear_keys ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! This is for destroying the "keys" externally.
   end

   read_keys ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Read a new set of keys
   end

   redirect ::: get_from(OBJECT), leaky
   ! Redirect input. (This code is for non-pointer self objects).
   end

   revert ::: get_from(OBJECT), leaky
   ! Revert back to previous stdin file. (This code is for non-pointer self
   ! objects).

!  ===========================
!  Non-list based I/O routines
!  ===========================

   read_keywords ::: get_from(VEC{OBJECT}), leaky
   ! This version is for allocatable arrays.
   ! Read in and process normal (non list-type) keywords from "stdin".
   end

   process_keyword(keyword) ::: get_from(VEC{BASIS})
   ! Process a normal (non list-type) "keyword".
   end

   read_library_directory ::: get_from(VEC{BASIS})
   ! Read the directory name for where the basis set libraries are stored.
   end

   read_library_data(library,labels,n_unique_labels) ::: get_from(VEC{BASIS}), leaky
   ! Open the file named "library", read the basis sets which have the right
   ! "labels", and assign them to the basis vector.  The file must begin with a
   ! "{" symbol and must have at least one "data=" list-type keyword following
   ! the open bracket. NOTE: Self is created or expanded by the number of unique
   ! labels in "labels" -- those which cannot be found already in "self".
